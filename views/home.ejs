          we all know that we generally don't get appointments with doctors all
          the time. once you try offline, you would possibly await an extended
          time. Now, once you do this online, the story is different. once you
          prefer digital healthcare platforms and doctors give preference to
          those that use these platforms. It helps you get nearby doctors
          together with your online appointments.The system of online
          appointments is straightforward and less hectic.The doctors respond
          also very quickly online. Offline appointments, on the opposite hand,
          don't have this technique of quick response.
